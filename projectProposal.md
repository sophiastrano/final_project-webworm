Webworm Teaches You Web Safety will be an important tool to help people understand how to be safe on the internet. This will include informative graphics, texts, and a brief quiz to help ensure that people do not fall for scams or get viruses. The intended users would be students or anyone seeking to improve their technical literacy when it comes to piracy and phishing. When visiting the site, users will be able to navigate between sections of content describing the definition of sensitive information, examples of common phishing scams, and tips to help increase general data security. There will be an emboldened link on the page that directs users to a quick quiz on phishing- multiple examples of a potential scam will pop up on screen, and after each question the correct answer will be displayed. 

While creating this web application, static design will be produced with consideration to C.R.A.P. principles and accessible UI. Our planned primary CSS/HTML framework would be Bootstrap, based on experience from a3. Dynamic behavior in this application would be covered by the server-side validation of quiz responses, as well as the pop-up of the quiz itself.
